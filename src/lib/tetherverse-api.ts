/**
 * Client for the Tetherverse API.
 *
 * The frontend holds no database code, no Postgres credentials, and no Supabase
 * keys. It forwards requests to the API service and returns what comes back.
 *
 * This is the BFF layer, and it exists for three reasons:
 *
 *  1. The `tetherverse` schema is not exposed to the Supabase Data API, so the
 *     browser could not read it even if it wanted to. Only the API service can.
 *  2. The API's address is never sent to the browser, so the service topology is
 *     not published.
 *  3. The Excel Play token is forwarded as an opaque bearer. The API verifies it
 *     against the accounts backend itself, so this layer never needs to, and never
 *     needs the accounts backend's address either.
